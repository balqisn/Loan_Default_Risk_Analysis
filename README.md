## Loan Default Risk Analysis
This project analyzes risk factors that contribute to loan default using a bank loan dataset.

### Objective
To identify patterns and predict possibility of default using Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, and scikit-learn.

### Key Findings
- Random Forest model achieved a high ROC AUC Score of 98%, indicating strong predictive performance.
- Even though Income, Loan Amount, Rate of Interest, DTIR1, and LTV are risk-related features, the model suggests that the overall risk of default is relatively low, indicating that most borrowers are under control.
- The rate of interest has the highest feature importance, which means that a higher interest rate is associated with a greater risk of loan default.
